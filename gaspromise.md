An important aspect of smart contract development is making your code efficient to minimize the gas you/other users spend when calling functions. This can have a serious impact on user retention for your protocol. Imagine you have to exchange 0.1 ETH for 300 USDC, but you have to pay 30 USDC in gas fees. No one wants to pay that. It's your duty as a developer to minimize gas consumption.
